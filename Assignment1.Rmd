## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{R}
ds.salaries <- read.csv("C:/Users/spadd/OneDrive/Desktop/ds_salaries.csv")```{R}
ds.salaries
```

```{R}
#creating descriptive statistics
summary(ds.salaries)
```
```{R}
#transformation of variable
ds.salaries$salary <- (ds.salaries$salary)/1000
ds.salaries$salary
```

```{R}
#creating scatterplots
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ds.salaries, aes(x = work_year, y = salary_in_usd))+ geom_point(color = "Green") + 
  labs(title = "ScatterPlot of Workyear & Salary", x = "work_year", y = "salary_in_usd")
```

```{R}
#creating histogram
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ds.salaries, aes(x = salary_in_usd)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "yellow", color = "black")
